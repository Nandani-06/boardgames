Git Steps for Pushing Changes to an Existing Branch

Follow these steps to push your changes to an existing branch (such as demo) in your GitHub repository.

1. Fetch the Latest Changes
   To ensure you're working with the most up-to-date version of the demo branch, fetch the latest changes from the remote repository:
   "git fetch origin"

2. Switch to the demo Branch
   If you're not already on the demo branch, switch to it using the checkout command:
   "git checkout demo"

3. Stage Your Changes
   After making changes to the files, you need to stage them before committing. To stage all modified files, use:
   "git add ."

4. Commit Your Changes
   Once your changes are staged, commit them with a meaningful message. For example, if you updated the preprocess.sh file to fix the rating handling, use:
   "git commit -m "Add your comment" "

5. Push Your Changes to the demo Branch
   After committing your changes, push them to the demo branch on GitHub:
   "git push origin demo"
